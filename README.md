# item-item-LSH-on-MovieLens-dataset
Item-Item Collaborative Filtering using Locality Sensitive Hashing on MovieLens Dataset

This project was done for the course of Large Scale Data Mining of Universidade de Aveiro.

This repository includes a ipynb file and a pdf presentation on the subject. The ipynb file runs on pyspark.

The ipynb file is pretty well commented but any question feel free to reach out.
For high ammounts of samples the program takes a while to run. 3M samples took me about 12h to run.

Dataset website bellow, the one used was the reccommended onw for education and development full size.
